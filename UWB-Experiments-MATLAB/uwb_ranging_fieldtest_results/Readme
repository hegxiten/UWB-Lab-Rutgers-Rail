Readme file for DataProcessing.py:

It is used for collecting data from the experiment logs, process it using Pandas Dataframe and then convert the processed dataframe into .csv format.

Steps:
1. Input the name of the log file you want to process into Line 3. If an error occurs, input the entire path instead of just the name. Eg: C://uwb//xyz_processed_log.log instead of xyz_processed_log.log
2. Run the program.
3. The processed dataframe will be displayed on the output terminal and a .csv file will be generated containing its values.

Files to use:
1. For V2-THINKPADP52-BallastRegulator-Moving-1, please use B side processed log. Since there is no vehicle facing A side, the log is empty.
2. For V1-THINKPADT430-Tamper-Moving-1, please use A side processed log. Since there is no vehicle facing B side, the log is empty.
3. For V2-THINKPADT430-BallastRegulator-Moving-2 and V3-THINKPADP52-Virtual-Moving-2, please use both A and B side processed logs depending on the timestamps. This was the experiment with the virtual vehicle and the moving vehicle was operating on both sides of the virtual vehicle.
4. For V2-THINKPADP52-BallastRegulator-Static, please use B side processed log. Since there is no vehicle facing A side, the log is empty.
5. For V1-THINKPADT430-Tamper-Static, please use A side processed log. Since there is no vehicle facing B side, the log is empty.

Do not rename files downloaded from Google Drive as data is also collected from the file names.
